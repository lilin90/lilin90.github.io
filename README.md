This is Lilian Lee's personal website in English: https://lilianlee.me/

The source files are maintained in the "[source](https://github.com/lilin90/lilin90.github.io/tree/source)" branch of this repository. This website uses the [Hugoplate](https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate/) Hugo theme, and once used the [Tranquilpeak](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) theme before that.

I maintain the [awesome-technical-communication](https://github.com/lilin90/awesome-technical-communication) open-source project to share awesome resources about technical communication.

I also write posts on technical communication in Chinese, and you can see these posts on my [WeChat subscription account](https://res.cloudinary.com/lilian-photos/image/upload/v1726561496/cover/wechat-qrcode-scan-to-follow-tcfun.jpg) or [Zhihu Column](https://www.zhihu.com/column/tc-fun).
