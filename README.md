This is Lilian Lee's personal blog in English: https://lilianlee.me/

The source files are maintained in the "[source](https://github.com/lilin90/lilin90.github.io/tree/source)" branch of this repository. This blog uses the [Tranquilpeak](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/) Hugo theme.

I write posts on technical communication in Chinese often, and you can see these posts on my [WeChat subscription account](https://res.cloudinary.com/lilian-photos/image/upload/v1585391408/cover/wechat-qrcode-scan-to-follow.jpg) or [Zhihu Column](https://www.zhihu.com/column/tc-fun).

I also maintain the [awesome-technical-communication](https://github.com/lilin90/awesome-technical-communication) open-source project to share awesome resources about technical communication.
