      <description>Remote work becomes popular all over the world in the context of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). I&amp;rsquo;ve worked remotely for three months since Feb 3, 2020. Before this, I only WFH occasionally, each time within three days. So it&amp;rsquo;s the first time that I WFH for a relatively long period of time.
  May 18, 2020 is the day that all staff at PingCAP (the company that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for since Aug 3, 2017) can return back to the offices.</description>
