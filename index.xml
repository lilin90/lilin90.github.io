      <description>Remote work becomes popular all over the world in the context of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). I&amp;rsquo;ve worked remotely for three months since Feb 3, 2020. Before this, I only WFH occasionally, each time within three days. So it&amp;rsquo;s the first time that I WFH for a relatively long period of time.
  May 18, 2020 is the day that all staff at PingCAP (the company that I work for) can return back to the offices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Technical Writer who has been using GitHub on each workday and on some weekends since August 2017. I write things now and then on several Chinese platforms such as WeChat Subscription Account (scan the QR code to follow) and Zhihu Column (click to follow).
At the end of 2018, after I got familiar with GitHub Pages, &amp;ldquo;a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository&amp;rdquo;, and Hugo, &amp;ldquo;one of the most popular open-source static site generators&amp;rdquo;, I built a personal blog by myself.</description>
